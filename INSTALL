The software is implemented under TominhTien's Master Thesis.

Description: 	serial-ip is a software for communicating between a serial machine and 
				remote host via Sabre-Lite board.

Instruction:

This is the INSTALL file for serial-ip software located at server side.  You will need
to build the program from the supplied source before you install it. Therefore, you 
will need a C development system. For the purpose of a portable software, one can using
the Makefile and edit for his/her platform and compiler.
Here, I am using my binary file generated via Eclipse.

Step 1 & 2 is for those who need recompile on their platform. 
  1.  Edit the Makefile for your platform and compiler.

  2.  Type 'make'.  A single executable, serial_ip, should be 
      built.

  3.  There is no 'install' target in the Makefile.  You must 
      install it "by hand".  To do so, copy the serial_ip 
      executable to the bin directory of your choice.  For 
      example (on Linux):

      # cp serial_ip /usr/local/bin
      # cp serial_ip /usr/local/sbin


  4.  Copy the included configuration file, serial_ip.conf, to 
      the /etc directory and edit it for your environment:

      # cp serial_ip.conf /etc
      # chown root:root /etc/serial_ip.conf
      # chmod 644 /etc/serial_ip.conf
      # vi /etc/serial_ip.conf

      The config file tells the serial-ip daemon which ports 
      it should make available over the network.

  5.  Arrange to have serial-ip started when your system boots. 
      A sample rc script for Ubuntu Linux is included.  For 
      example, this script is writen for Ubuntu:

      # cp serial_ip.init /etc/init.d/serial_ip
      # chown root:root /etc/init.d/serial_ip
      # chmod 755 /etc/init.d/serial_ip
 
  6.  Change permission for the working serial port. For example:
  	  
  	  # chmod o+rw /dev/ttyS1
	  # chmod o+rw /dev/ttyUSB0	
  	  # chmod o+rw /dev/ttymxc0    (for Sabre)	

      By default, serial_ip runs on port 1194.  You can specify a 
      different port by using the "-p" option at startup.  To do so, 
      you will need to edit the rc script.

  7. To start serial-ip now, on Ubuntu Linux:

	  #mkdir /var/lock/subsys
	  #mkdir /var/spool/uucp
	  #chmod o+rw /dev/<serial_port>	
      # service serial_ip start
      
      If you want to run manually, follow these commands:
      # serial_ip -d
      # serial_ip -p 1194
